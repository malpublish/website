## Lifecycle

|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| architecture.md | On significant pattern changes | Never (keep current) |
| integrations.md | When services added/changed | Never |
| initiatives/*.md | Continuously during work | Archive when complete (preserves decisions) |
| users/*.md | When user research conducted | Update, don't archive |
| artifacts/*.md | When adding reference content | Never (static reference) |

> **Keep docs fresh**: Update timestamps (`<!-- Last updated: -->`) when editing. Stale docs are worse than no docs.
